    " - But in particular what's inside the parentheses is slightly different notation. So the first thing that's slightly different is that the string-- the text enclosed in double quotation marks-- begins with the letter F. This is a **new feature of Python version 3.6-- the latest version-- called the format strings**, which let us take a string, take text and substitute information by filling in blanks in the string wherever we want to put a placeholder for some other value, for instance. And so what that's going to allow us to do is say something like print hello comma. And then these curly braces surrounding the word name mean take the variable name and plug it into this format string inserted here. So whatever name gets typed in, that gets saved into this variable called name. And then when I print something out, I'm printing out the word hello comma, and then here, we're going to insert whatever that name was that was passed in via the input."
